This is the Backend of the E-commerce app.
This is built upon the node.js, express.js packages.
It contains feature like JWT Authentication, database, bcrypt etc.
Use Command "nodemon app.js" to start backend.
This E-commerce app uses role based fetures like Consumer, Admin, Owner.
The Database is built on MongoDB Atlas.
I deployed the frontend part on netlify that's working fine and I deployed backend on railway but the free trial expired so the backend is not working and there is no other platform which gives this free trial feature with adding credit card.
